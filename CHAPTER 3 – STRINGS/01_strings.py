# string is a data type
# sting can be primarily written in 3 ways
a ='harry' # Single quoted string

# string slicing (getting a part of the strings)
# string is immutable(cant be changed/modified once made)

len(name) # function to find length of the string
name1 = name[0:3] # start from index 0 (0 included) all the way till index 3 (excluding 3)
print(name1)
